You need two textures for this material to work. First texture I have used is named "T_Fire_Tiled_D" and you can find it in the starter content.
Second texture is a plain red diffuse color. The one I used belonged to a paid UI pack so I'm not allowed to share it. But you can find something like that easily with a little search.
